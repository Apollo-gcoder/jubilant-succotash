# jubilant-succotash
This is my first repository called jubilant-succotash, which will be used for my CS and DS personal curriculum and serve to contain all projects related to MITx 6.00.1x, Harvard CS50, quantecon.org python, etc. leading up to a possible future career/job in CS, IT, software devolopment, data science, or any related field.
If you have any interests in game theory, chaos theory, complex systems, cognitive science, linguistics, probability and statistics, their underlying philosophies, and their myriad applications, I am also very interested, and therefore have much to learn. Let's have a conversation. :-)
